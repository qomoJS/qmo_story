Situate amidst the serene hills,
A heart that yearns for solitude stills.
Device of dreams, weave webs of night,
Whisper secrets 'neath starlit light.
Pass heart, leap over fences,
geek the sun, ignore the censures.
Mention not the past's shadows,
But dance with the present's glows.
Detect the hidden melodies,
Whispered by the whispering trees.
Long ago, in a forgotten land,
A love so pure, it never decayed.
Gift of life, a spark within,
Ignites the soul, a journey begins.
Black as the midnight sky,
My heart yearns for the light to rise.
Obtain the wisdom of the ages,
Inscribed in stone, whispered by the sages.
Seek the truth beyond illusions,
Unravel mysteries, find life's delusions.
Wasp buzz cuts through the silence,
A warning note, a nature's dance.
Elder tree stands tall and wise,
Guarding secrets, whispering lies.
